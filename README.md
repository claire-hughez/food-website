# Food Website

We've eaten at a lot of places around London. This is to track some of those and maybe provide
recommendations whenever others ask about them.

Potential feature list:
* Tagging of restaurants (location/cuisine/e.t.c.)
  * Filtering by tags
* Page of greatest hits/top 10/whatever
* Listing favourite items on menu
* Individual pages for each restaurant, with optional commentary, map of locations, e.t.c.

Built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
